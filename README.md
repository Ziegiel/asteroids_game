# Asteroids (practice project)

Small Asteroids-style game written in Python using `pygame`.  
Created as a practice project to play with basic game loops, collision handling and simple logging.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 (pygame is not yet compatible with 3.14)
- `uv` for dependency management
- `pygame` (declared in `pyproject.toml`)

## How to run

1. Install dependencies with uv:

   uv sync

2. Start the game:

   uv run main.py
